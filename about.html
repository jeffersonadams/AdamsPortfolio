    <div class="aboutVideoGames">
      <p><b>Videogames</b></p>
      <p>I've played different videogames since I was a little kid. I've always prefered playing games on PC. Some games I've spent a notable amount of time playing include:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li>RuneScape</li>
          <li>Counterstrike: Global Offensive</li>
          <li>League of Legends</li>
          <li>World of Warcraft</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="aboutPizza">
      <p><b>Pizza</b></br></p>
      <p>Pizza is my favorite kind of food because its really hard to screw up. It requires simple ingredients and is delicious. My favorite pizza is from a pizza place in my hometown, called Pizza Rama. You can find their hours and phone number to order <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizza-rama-green-springs">here.</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class="aboutBrownBears">
      <p><b>Brown bears</b></br></p>
      <p>Finally, brown bears are my favorite animal. I just think they're so cute, and its really cool that they are also insanely strong. They kind of remind me of really big dogs, and man do I love dogs.</p>
